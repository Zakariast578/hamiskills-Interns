📂 **Final Project (Week 4)**  

**Repository:**  
- Main: https://github.com/Zakariast578/Customer-Purchase-Prediction  

**Tech Stack & Tools:**  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- Scikit-Learn (classification models, model selection)  
- Streamlit (interactive web app)  
- Git & GitHub  

**Project Overview:**  
A customer purchase prediction system that trains and evaluates multiple machine learning models to predict whether a customer will complete a purchase.  

**Key Features:**  
- Data preprocessing and cleaning (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling)  
- Feature engineering to improve predictive performance  
- Model comparison (Random Forest vs Logistic Regression and others as needed)  
- Performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC  
- Streamlit web application for real-time customer prediction and result visualization  
- Clear project structure with notebooks, scripts, and documentation  

**How to Run the Project (Suggested Structure):**  
1. Clone the repository  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Zakariast578/Customer-Purchase-Prediction.git
    cd Customer-Purchase-Prediction
    ```  
2. Create and activate a virtual environment  
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```  
3. Install dependencies  
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```  
4. Run the Streamlit app  
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

📝 **Notes**  
I joined the HamSkills Internship to strengthen my machine learning and data analysis skills. Through this project, I learned how to build an end-to-end ML pipeline: from understanding customer behavior and engineering meaningful features, to comparing models and deploying an interactive application for real-time predictions.
